%%%%% ABSTRACT %%%%

\begin{abstract}

In this paper, we evaluated the performance of Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Machine as images classifier, using Bag of Word model. Different metric functions and different kernel functions were taken into account. With regard to feature quantization, we have focused our attention to soft-assignment and localized soft-assignment, in comparison to hard-assignment.
