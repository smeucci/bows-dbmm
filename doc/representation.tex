\section{Image representation}

In BoW model each image is represented as a histogram of \emph{visual words} occurrences through local descriptor quantization\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1304-5168}. These histograms are used to train an image category classifier.

To quantize local descriptors into visual words, we must first generate visual vocabulary. 

\subsection{Vocabulary creation}

The visual vocabulary for BoW model is often generated by clustering of images local descriptors. In this case we \emph{k-means} algorithm as clustering method.

This algorithm iteratively groups the descriptors into $k$ mutually exclusive clusters, where $k$ is the preset \emph{vocabulary size}. The resulting cluster are compact and separated by similar characteristics so they are trated as a unique visual word from the vocabulary. Each cluster center represents the entire cluster and it is store as a unique visual word in the vocabulary.
